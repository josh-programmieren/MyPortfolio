    <h1>My hobbies - without programming, of caurse!</h1>
    <div id="music">
        <h2>Making and hearing music</h2>
        <h3>Making music</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Singing</h4>
            <p>
                I like to sing. In primary school, I was in the students choir, called "Die Neubergs√§nger". I was a member of the choir from second to fourth class.
            </p>
            <h4>Playing drums</h4>
            <p>
                I had drum lessons for a long time. I also played drums in music lessons, when we had to play a song in groups.
            </p>
            <h4>Making music with LMMS</h4>
            <p>
                I teach myself how to use LMMS to make music. But I am not a musician. I only use it for experimental purposes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Listening to music</h3>
        <div>
            I listen to music using the Spotify app. When I am in the car (while traveling), I listen to music on the radio or use headphones.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="climbing">
        <h2>Climbing</h2>
        <p>
            When I was younger, I was part of a climbing group. In this group, we climbed in a hall.
            <br>
            <strong>Special: In this group, there were children in any age and with and without special needs.</strong>
            <br>
            <em>But being school student is a really job. So I don't climb for about a year</em>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="kitchen">
        <h2>Cooking and baking</h2>
        <p>
            I like to cook and to bake. I make good (salat) sauces and I help my parents in the kitchen.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="stories">
        <h2>Reading and writing</h2>
        <div id="reading">
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                When I find a book whose font size is big enough, and whose story is interesting, I read it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="writing">
            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p>
                I like writing. In primary school, we had a subject called "Schreibwerkstatt".
